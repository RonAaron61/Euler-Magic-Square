# Euler-Magic-Square
Creating Euler Magic Square / Magic Square using the odd method

## What is Magic Square:

Magic square if the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square]

Trying to make program that can make magic square on any size, but curently the sum of the diagonal is still not matching the sum of row and column

the method I use:

consist of two part, the main number, and adder number. The two numbers will then be added together, but each row is placed differently (like playing sudoku for both main and adder number)
